Created a calculator that will take the input values of a an added employee and append them to a table on the DOM. The calculator will take the Annual Salary input value for every employee and add them together and divide by 12 to get the monthly cost. If the monthly cost exceeds 20,000 the text will turn red indicating that the monthly cost is too high. There is a selector box next to each added employee that allows you to delete them.
